I'm new to the tech world, not exactly sure what position is right for me in tech. Although something with a great team and work enviroment that I can learn and become a reliant programmer is what im seeking. 

After seeing two of my good friends take the cyber course here at city of refuge and how there lives have completely transformed from having careers in tech, I decided to follow there lead and enter into the industry that has always interested me but felt inaccessible for so long.
